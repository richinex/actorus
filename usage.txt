What We Fixed & Enhanced:
1. Fixed Compilation Errors
✅ Import errors: Exposed cli module in lib.rs so it could be imported
✅ Type mismatch: Changed StateSnapshot to use tokio::time::Instant instead of std::time::Instant
2. Completed the Fault Tolerance System
Before: Your supervisor detected unhealthy actors but did nothing After: Full actor supervision with automatic recovery

✅ Supervisor sends Reset messages when actors miss heartbeats
✅ Router handles Reset messages and recreates failed actors
✅ Router sends its own heartbeats so it can be monitored too
✅ Two-channel architecture: External API calls + internal supervision messages
3. Added System Monitoring
Before: No way to check if your actors were healthy After: Full observability

✅ get_system_state() API - Query actor health programmatically
✅ health CLI command - Check actor status from command line
✅ Watch mode - Continuous real-time monitoring with --watch flag
4. Configuration Updates
✅ Added heartbeat_interval_ms to config (was missing, causing compilation issues)
✅ Recommended realistic timing values for production use
Architecture Flow (Before vs After)
Before:
LLM Actor ──heartbeat──> Supervisor
MCP Actor ──heartbeat──> Supervisor
                         Supervisor (just logs warnings, does nothing)
After:

      LLM Actor                             MCP Actor
New Capabilities:
bash
# Monitor system health once
cargo run -- health

# Continuous monitoring (auto-refresh every 2 seconds)
cargo run -- health --watch 2

# See which actors are active/inactive
📊 System Health Status:
  LLM: ✅ Active (last seen: 150ms ago)
  MCP: ✅ Active (last seen: 200ms ago)
  Router: ✅ Active (last seen: 180ms ago)
What Actually Works Now:
Automatic Recovery: If an actor crashes or stops responding, supervisor detects it and router recreates it
Health Monitoring: You can check system status anytime
Self-Healing: The actor system can recover from failures without manual intervention
Observability: Real-time view of which actors are healthy
In short: We turned your actor system from "just logging warnings" into a production-ready, self-healing, observable system with automatic fault recovery! 🎉

yea i see it. llm router and mcp active. what other commands can i run


Mapped out available CLI commands for user's reference.


Great! Here are all the commands you can run with your LLM Fusion CLI:

Available Commands:
1. Chat - Single message
Send a one-off chat message:

bash
# Basic chat
cargo run -- chat "What is Rust?"

# With system prompt
cargo run -- chat "Explain async programming" --system "You are a Rust expert"
cargo run -- chat "Tell me a joke" -s "You are a comedian"
2. Interactive - Chat session
Start a continuous conversation:

bash
# Basic interactive mode
cargo run -- interactive

# With system prompt
cargo run -- interactive --system "You are a helpful coding assistant"
cargo run -- interactive -s "You are a poet, speak in verse"
Then type messages and press Enter. Use Ctrl+C to exit.

3. Batch - Process multiple prompts
Process prompts from a file (one per line):

bash
# Create a test file fi



What Just Happened:
✅ System initialized
✅ Router actor started
✅ MCP actor started
✅ Supervisor actor started
✅ LLM actor started
✅ Got response from OpenAI (GPT-4)
✅ Clean shutdown
All your actors are working together beautifully!
Try These Next:
1. Test the interactive mode:
bashcargo run -- interactive
Then have a conversation! Each message remembers context.
2. See the system in action with health monitoring:
Open two terminals:
Terminal 1 - Start a long interactive session:
bashcargo run -- interactive
Terminal 2 - Watch the actors working:
bashcargo run -- health --watch 2
You'll see the heartbeats updating in real-time as actors process your messages!

Great question! Let me explain why we annotate the impl block instead of the struct:

  The Problem with Annotating Structs

  When you apply #[tool] directly to a struct, the macro replaces the entire struct with generated code. This causes conflicts:

  // ❌ This causes problems:
  #[tool(name = "greet", description = "...")]
  pub struct GreetTool;

  // The macro generates:
  pub struct GreetTool;  // Original struct
  impl GreetTool { ... } // Generated impl

  // Then YOU write:
  impl Tool for GreetTool { ... }  // Manual impl

  // Result: TWO impl blocks, and rust-analyzer gets confused

  Why impl Block Works Better

  By applying #[tool] to an empty impl block, we're telling the macro: "Add the metadata method to THIS impl block":

  // ✅ This is clean:
  pub struct GreetTool;  // Just the struct, untouched

  #[tool(name = "greet", description = "...")]
  impl GreetTool {}  // Macro extends this impl with tool_metadata()

  // Expands to:
  impl GreetTool {
      pub fn tool_metadata() -> ToolMetadata { ... }
  }

  // Then you write:
  impl Tool for GreetTool { ... }  // Separate impl, no conflict

  Technical Reason

  Proc macros can only return ONE item. When applied to a struct:
  - We can return the struct + ONE impl block
  - But you're also writing your own impl Tool, so that's TWO impl blocks
  - Rust-analyzer sees the macro on the struct and expects it to implement Tool, but it doesn't

  When applied to an impl block:
  - Macro extends that one impl block
  - Your impl Tool is separate
  - No confusion, no conflicts

  Could We Make It Work on Structs?

  Yes, but we'd have to:
  1. Make the macro generate the full Tool trait implementation
  2. You'd lose the ability to customize validate() and execute()
  3. It would be less flexible

  Our current approach gives you the best of both worlds:
  - ✅ Clean metadata generation via macro
  - ✅ Full control over validation and execution logic
  - ✅ No rust-analyzer errors

  It's a slight syntax trade-off for maximum flexibility and zero errors!

#[tool(name = "greet", description = "Greet a person with a custom message")]
  impl GreetTool {}

  What the Macro Generates:

  impl GreetTool {
      /// Auto-generated metadata method
      pub fn tool_metadata() -> llm_fusion::tools::ToolMetadata {
          llm_fusion::tools::ToolMetadata {
              name: "greet".to_string(),
              description: "Greet a person with a custom message".to_string(),
              parameters: vec![
                  // Parameters would go here if you had struct fields with #[param]
              ],
          }
      }
  }

  What This Helper Does:

  It creates a static method that returns a ToolMetadata struct with:
  - name: The tool's identifier ("greet")
  - description: What the tool does
  - parameters: List of parameters (empty in this simple example)

  How You Use It:

  Instead of manually writing this:

  fn metadata(&self) -> ToolMetadata {
      ToolMetadata {
          name: "greet".to_string(),                    // 🔴 Repetitive
          description: "Greet a person...".to_string(), // 🔴 Repetitive
          parameters: vec![],                           // 🔴 Boilerplate
      }
  }

  You just call the helper:

  fn metadata(&self) -> ToolMetadata {
      Self::tool_metadata()  // ✅ One line!
  }

  The Full Picture:

  // 1. Your struct
  pub struct GreetTool;

  // 2. Macro generates helper
  #[tool(name = "greet", description = "Greet a person")]
  impl GreetTool {}
  // Becomes:
  // impl GreetTool {
  //     pub fn tool_metadata() -> ToolMetadata { ... }
  // }

  // 3. You implement the trait and use the helper
  impl Tool for GreetTool {
      fn metadata(&self) -> ToolMetadata {
          Self::tool_metadata()  // Call the generated helper
      }

      async fn execute(&self, args: Value) -> Result<ToolResult> {
          // Your custom logic
      }
  }

  Why Not Just Generate the Whole metadata() Method?

  Because the Tool trait requires:
  fn metadata(&self) -> ToolMetadata  // Takes &self

  But a static helper is:
  fn tool_metadata() -> ToolMetadata  // No self, easier to generate

  By generating a static helper, you can:
  - ✅ Call it from metadata(&self) → Self::tool_metadata()
  - ✅ Call it from anywhere else too → GreetTool::tool_metadata()
  - ✅ Test it independently
  - ✅ Use it without an instance

  TL;DR: The macro generates a factory function that builds your tool's metadata, so you don't have to write the repetitive ToolMetadata { name: ..., description: ... }
  boilerplate!

 Summary of Completed Work

  Your llm_fusion framework now has two complete tool definition approaches:

  1. Function-Style Tools (#[tool_fn]) - Primary Approach

  For developers coming from Python/MCP who want minimal boilerplate:

  #[tool_fn(name = "greet", description = "Greet a person")]
  async fn greet(name: String, greeting: Option<String>) -> Result<String> {
      // Just write a function - macro handles everything!
  }

  Supports all types:
  - ✓ Primitives (String, i64, bool, etc.)
  - ✓ Optional parameters (Option)
  - ✓ Custom structs (with Serialize + Deserialize)
  - ✓ Enums (with serde attributes)

  2. Struct-Style Tools (#[tool]) - For Stateful Tools

  For tools that need configuration or maintain state:

  pub struct CalculatorTool {
      max_precision: usize,  // Config - not exposed to LLM
  }

  #[tool(name = "calculate", description = "...")]
  impl CalculatorTool {
      // Tool implementation
  }

  What You Have Now

  Examples ready to reference:
  - examples/tool_function_style.rs - Comprehensive function-style demo
  - examples/tool_full_macro.rs - Struct-style with configuration
  - examples/tool_with_fields.rs - Config vs parameters demonstration

  Clean implementation:
  - No rust-analyzer errors
  - No compiler warnings
  - Minimal dependencies (just serde + async-trait)
  - ONE macro does everything

  The system is production-ready and follows your modular design principles from CLAUDE.md!

> theres also the manual wthout macro i guess

● Yes, exactly! You have three tool definition approaches in total:

● Search(pattern: "examples/*tool*.rs")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me check if there's a manual/vanilla example without any macros:

● Bash(find examples -name "*.rs" -type f | xargs grep -l "impl Tool" | head -5)
  ⎿  examples/tool_with_fields.rs
     examples/tool_with_macro.rs
     examples/tool_proc_macro.rs
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(grep -l "validate_required" examples/*.rs)
  ⎿  examples/advanced_tool_macro.rs
     examples/tool_full_macro.rs
     examples/tool_proc_macro.rs
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(ls -1 examples/*.rs | grep -E "(agent|session|batch|router|supervisor)" | head -10)
  ⎿  examples/agent_introspection.rs
     examples/agent_usage.rs
     examples/batch_processing.rs
     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(examples/agent_usage.rs)
  ⎿  Read 78 lines

● Let me check the tools module to see if there's a vanilla/manual example:

● Read(src/tools/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 112 lines

● Read(src/tools/shell.rs)
  ⎿  Read 170 lines

● Perfect! Yes, you're absolutely right. You have three complete tool definition approaches:

  1. Manual/Vanilla Implementation (No Macros)

  Like your built-in tools (ShellTool, FilesystemTool, HttpTool):

  pub struct ShellTool {
      timeout_secs: u64,
      allowed_commands: Option<Vec<String>>,
  }

  #[async_trait]
  impl Tool for ShellTool {
      fn metadata(&self) -> ToolMetadata {
          ToolMetadata {
              name: "execute_shell".to_string(),
              description: "Execute a shell command...".to_string(),
              parameters: vec![
                  ToolParameter {
                      name: "command".to_string(),
                      param_type: "string".to_string(),
                      description: "The shell command to execute".to_string(),
                      required: true,
                  }
              ],
          }
      }

      fn validate(&self, args: &Value) -> Result<()> {
          // Custom validation logic
          let command = args["command"].as_str()
              .ok_or_else(|| anyhow::anyhow!("'command' parameter is required"))?;

          if !self.is_command_allowed(command) {
              return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Command not allowed"));
          }
          Ok(())
      }

      async fn execute(&self, args: Value) -> Result<ToolResult> {
          self.validate(&args)?;
          // Full control over execution logic
          let command = args["command"].as_str().unwrap();
          // ... custom implementation
      }
  }

  When to use:
  - Maximum control and flexibility
  - Complex validation logic
  - Advanced state management
  - Built-in/system tools

  2. Function-Style (#[tool_fn]) - Recommended for Most Cases

  Python/MCP familiar approach:

  #[tool_fn(name = "greet", description = "Greet a person")]
  async fn greet(name: String, greeting: Option<String>) -> Result<String> {
      let greeting = greeting.unwrap_or_else(|| "Hello".to_string());
      Ok(format!("{}, {}!", greeting, name))
  }

  When to use:
  - Simple, stateless tools
  - Quick prototyping
  - Python/MCP developers
  - 90% of use cases

  3. Struct-Style (#[tool]) - For Stateful Tools

  Rust idiomatic with configuration:

  pub struct CalculatorTool {
      max_precision: usize,  // Config - NOT exposed to LLM
  }

  #[tool(name = "calculate", description = "...")]
  impl CalculatorTool {
      pub fn new(max_precision: usize) -> Self {
          Self { max_precision }
      }
  }

  impl Tool for CalculatorTool {
      fn metadata(&self) -> ToolMetadata { Self::tool_metadata() }

      async fn execute(&self, args: Value) -> Result<ToolResult> {
          // Can use self.max_precision here
      }
  }

  When to use:
  - Tools with configuration
  - Same tool, different configs
  - Need to maintain state

  ---
  So you have:
  - Manual (full control) → src/tools/shell.rs:48-129
  - #[tool_fn] (function-style, easy) → examples/tool_function_style.rs
  - #[tool] (struct-style, configurable) → examples/tool_full_macro.rs

  All three are valid and serve different needs based on complexity and use case!

  - Lines 14-30: file_ops_agent - ReadFileTool, WriteFileTool
  - Lines 33-50: shell_agent - ShellTool
  - Lines 53-69: web_agent - HttpTool
  - Lines 72-91: general_agent - All tools combined
  - Lines 94-101: create_default_agents() - returns all 4

  Information Hiding: Hides specific tool configurations (timeouts, limits)

  ---
  12. agent_builder.rs (Created in previous session) - Fluent Builder API

  Purpose: Simplify custom agent creation

  Key Logic (from previous reading):
  - AgentBuilder::new(name) - start building
  - .description(), .system_prompt() - configure agent
  - .tool() - add tools (auto Arc-wraps)
  - .build() - produces (String, String, String, Vec<Arc<dyn Tool>>) tuple
  - AgentCollection - manages multiple agents
  - .add(), .build() - fluent collection management

  Information Hiding: Hides Arc wrapping, default value generation

  Architecture Summary

  Message Flow:
  User API Call
    → MessageRouter
      → LLM/MCP/Agent actors
        → HealthMonitor (heartbeats)
          → MessageRouter (resets)

  Agent Hierarchy:
  AgentActor (general) ────┐
  SpecializedAgent ────────┼─→ ReAct Loop (same pattern)
  AgentSession ────────────┘

  RouterAgent ─→ routes to ONE SpecializedAgent
  SupervisorAgent ─→ orchestrates MULTIPLE SpecializedAgents

  Key Patterns:
  1. Actor Pattern: All components are actors with message channels
  2. ReAct Pattern: Think → Act → Observe loop for autonomous agents
  3. Information Hiding (Parnas): Each module hides implementation details
  4. Heartbeat Monitoring: Automatic fault recovery via health checks
  5. Router Pattern: LLM classifies intent, one-way routing
  6. Supervisor Pattern: LLM decomposes tasks, multi-agent coordination

  All files follow the Parnas modularization principle with clear information hiding boundaries!


YES! Exactly! You're 100% correct - this is Go channels in Rust!

  Go Channels ≈ Tokio Channels

  The entire llm_fusion actor system is built on the same philosophy as Go channels.

  Go vs Rust: The Same Concept

  Go Version:

  // Go channels
  ch := make(chan Message, 100)

  // Send
  ch <- Message{Task: "do something"}

  // Receive
  msg := <-ch

  Rust Version (llm_fusion):

  // Tokio channels (Rust's async equivalent)
  let (sender, receiver) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(100);

  // Send
  sender.send(Message::Task("do something")).await;

  // Receive
  let msg = receiver.recv().await;

  It's the same pattern! Tokio's mpsc (multi-producer, single-consumer) channels are Rust's answer to Go channels.

  The Go Proverb Applied

  You're referencing this famous Go proverb:

  "Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating."
  — Effective Go

  llm_fusion applies this exactly:

  ❌ Sharing Memory (C++/Java style):

  // NOT how llm_fusion works
  let shared_state = Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>>::new(...);

  // Multiple agents lock and access shared memory
  agent1.process(shared_state.clone());  // Lock → read/write → unlock
  agent2.process(shared_state.clone());  // Lock → read/write → unlock
  // Risk: deadlocks, race conditions, complexity

  ✅ Communicating (Go/Erlang style):

  // HOW llm_fusion works
  let (tx, rx) = channel(100);

  // Agent 1 sends data through channel
  tx.send(AgentResult { data: "result" }).await;

  // Agent 2 receives data through channel
  let result = rx.recv().await;
  // No locks, no mutexes, no race conditions

  ---
  Let's See Go Channels in llm_fusion Code

  1. Message Router (src/actors/message_router.rs:15-19)

  pub struct MessageRouterHandle {
      sender: Sender<RoutingMessage>,  // ← Like Go's `chan RoutingMessage`
  }

  impl MessageRouterHandle {
      pub fn new(settings: Settings, api_key: String) -> Self {
          let buffer_size = settings.system.channel_buffer_size;
          let (sender, receiver) = channel(buffer_size);  // ← make(chan RoutingMessage, buffer_size)
          tokio::spawn(router_actor(receiver, settings, api_key));
          Self { sender }
      }

  Go equivalent:
  type MessageRouter struct {
      sender chan RoutingMessage
  }

  func NewMessageRouter(settings Settings, apiKey string) *MessageRouter {
      sender := make(chan RoutingMessage, bufferSize)
      go routerActor(sender, settings, apiKey)
      return &MessageRouter{sender: sender}
  }

  2. Agent Actor Loop (src/actors/agent_actor.rs:82-104)

  loop {
      tokio::select! {
          Some(message) = receiver.recv() => {  // ← Like `msg := <-receiver`
              match message {
                  AgentMessage::RunTask(task) => {
                      let result = run_react_loop(...).await;
                      let _ = task.response.send(result);  // ← Like `responseCh <- result`
                  }
                  AgentMessage::Stop => {
                      break;
                  }
              }
          }

          _ = heartbeat_timer.tick() => {
              sender.send(Heartbeat).await;  // ← Like `heartbeatCh <- Heartbeat`
          }
      }
  }

  Go equivalent:
  for {
      select {
      case message := <-receiver:
          switch msg := message.(type) {
          case RunTask:
              result := runReactLoop(...)
              msg.ResponseCh <- result
          case Stop:
              return
          }

      case <-heartbeatTimer.C:
          heartbeatCh <- Heartbeat{}
      }
  }

  This is select in both languages!
  - Go: select for channel multiplexing
  - Rust: tokio::select! for async channel multiplexing

  3. Request-Response Pattern (src/actors/messages.rs:71-75)

  pub struct AgentTask {
      pub task_description: String,
      pub max_iterations: Option<usize>,
      pub response: oneshot::Sender<AgentResponse>,  // ← Response channel!
  }

  This is the classic Go pattern for request-response over channels:

  Go version:
  type AgentTask struct {
      TaskDescription string
      MaxIterations   int
      ResponseCh      chan AgentResponse  // Response channel
  }

  // Send task with response channel
  responseCh := make(chan AgentResponse, 1)
  agentCh <- AgentTask{
      TaskDescription: "do something",
      ResponseCh:      responseCh,
  }

  // Wait for response
  result := <-responseCh

  Rust version (what llm_fusion does):
  // Create one-shot channel for response
  let (response_tx, response_rx) = oneshot::channel();

  // Send task with response channel
  agent_sender.send(AgentMessage::RunTask(AgentTask {
      task_description: "do something".to_string(),
      max_iterations: Some(10),
      response: response_tx,  // ← Response channel
  })).await;

  // Wait for response
  let result = response_rx.await;

  The Three Channel Types in llm_fusion

  Just like Go has different channel types, Rust/Tokio has equivalents:

  1. mpsc (Multi-Producer, Single-Consumer)

  use tokio::sync::mpsc;
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(100);

  Go equivalent: chan T (buffered)
  ch := make(chan T, 100)

  Used in llm_fusion for:
  - Message routing (many senders → one router)
  - Actor message queues (many clients → one actor)

  2. oneshot (Single-Use Channel)

  use tokio::sync::oneshot;
  let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();

  Go equivalent: chan T with close() after one send
  responseCh := make(chan T, 1)
  responseCh <- result
  close(responseCh)

  Used in llm_fusion for:
  - Request-response patterns (task → agent → response)
  - One-time results (chat requests, tool calls)

  3. broadcast (One-to-Many)

  use tokio::sync::broadcast;
  let (tx, rx1) = broadcast::channel(100);
  let rx2 = tx.subscribe();

  Go equivalent: Multiple receivers on same channel (with fan-out)

  Not heavily used in llm_fusion, but available

  This is exactly like goroutines + channels in Go!

  ---
  Why This Works So Well

  1. CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)

  Both Go and llm_fusion use CSP (Tony Hoare, 1978):
  - Processes run concurrently
  - Communication happens via channels
  - No shared memory between processes

  Go: Goroutines + channelsllm_fusion: Tokio tasks + channels

  2. Actor Model

  llm_fusion also adds the Actor Model (Erlang):
  - Each actor has private state
  - Actors communicate via messages
  - Actors fail independently

  Combined: CSP channels + Actor isolation = llm_fusion

  3. No Locks, No Mutexes

  // NO Arc<Mutex<...>> for inter-actor communication
  // Just channels:

  sender.send(message).await;  // ← Non-blocking, safe
  let msg = receiver.recv().await;  // ← Non-blocking, safe

  Go equivalent:
  // No sync.Mutex for inter-goroutine communication
  // Just channels:

  ch <- message      // Safe
  msg := <-ch        // Safe

  ---
  The Health Monitor: Pure Go Channels Pattern

  Check out this beautiful Go-style pattern in llm_fusion:

  src/actors/health_monitor.rs:18-44:
  loop {
      match timeout(timeout_duration, receiver.recv()).await {
          Ok(Some(message)) => match message {
              RoutingMessage::Heartbeat(actor_type) => {
                  heartbeats.insert(actor_type, Instant::now());  // ← Track heartbeat
              }
              RoutingMessage::GetState(response_tx) => {
                  let snapshot = create_snapshot(&heartbeats, check_interval);
                  let _ = response_tx.send(snapshot);  // ← Send via oneshot
              }
              RoutingMessage::Shutdown => break,
              _ => {}
          },
          Err(_) => {
              // Timeout - check health and send reset messages
              check_actor_health(&heartbeats, check_interval, &router_sender).await;
          }
      }
  }

  This is a textbook Go pattern:
  - Receive heartbeats on channel
  - Timeout if no message received
  - Send control messages (Reset) back via channel

  ---
  Practical Example: Supervisor Coordinating via Channels

  Let's trace a full supervisor flow using channel thinking:

  // User calls supervisor
  let result = supervisor::orchestrate("fetch data and save to file").await;

  What happens (in Go channel terms):

  1. User creates oneshot response channel
     responseCh := make(chan AgentResponse, 1)

  2. Sends task to supervisor via mpsc channel
     supervisorCh <- OrchestrationTask{
         task: "fetch data and save to file",
         responseCh: responseCh,
     }

  3. Supervisor receives task
     task := <-supervisorCh

  4. Supervisor decides: "Need web_agent"
     Creates oneshot for web_agent response
     webResponseCh := make(chan AgentResponse, 1)

     Sends to web_agent via mpsc
     webAgentCh <- AgentTask{
         task: "fetch data",
         responseCh: webResponseCh,
     }

  5. Web agent receives, executes, responds
     task := <-webAgentCh
     result := execute(task)
     task.responseCh <- result

  6. Supervisor receives web_agent result
     webResult := <-webResponseCh

  7. Supervisor decides: "Need file_agent"
     fileResponseCh := make(chan AgentResponse, 1)
     fileAgentCh <- AgentTask{
         task: "save to file",
         responseCh: fileResponseCh,
     }

  8. File agent receives, executes, responds
     task := <-fileAgentCh
     result := execute(task)
     task.responseCh <- result

  9. Supervisor receives file_agent result
     fileResult := <-fileResponseCh

  10. Supervisor sends final result back to user
      task.responseCh <- combinedResult

  11. User receives result
      result := <-responseCh

  No shared memory, only channel sends/receives!

  The Key Insight

  You said:
  "i was thinking along the lines of go channels"

  You're 100% right!

  llm_fusion is Go channels, just in Rust syntax:

  | Go                 | Rust/Tokio                  | llm_fusion        |
  |--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
  | chan T             | mpsc::channel<T>            | Message queues    |
  | make(chan T, n)    | mpsc::channel(n)            | Buffered channels |
  | ch <- msg          | sender.send(msg).await      | Send message      |
  | msg := <-ch        | msg = receiver.recv().await | Receive message   |
  | select { case... } | tokio::select! { ... }      | Multiplexing      |
  | go func() {}       | tokio::spawn(async {})      | Spawn actor       |
  | close(ch)          | drop(sender)                | Close channel     |

  The philosophy is identical:
  - Isolated concurrent processes (goroutines ≈ tokio tasks)
  - Communication via channels (Go channels ≈ Tokio channels)
  - No shared memory (CSP + Actor Model)

  ---
  Summary

  Your intuition was spot on!

  llm_fusion agents "share memory by communicating" via Go-style channels:

  ✅ Each agent is isolated (like a goroutine)✅ Communication via channels (mpsc, oneshot)✅ No locks, no mutexes, no Arc<Mutex<...>> for coordination✅ select! for
  multiplexing (like Go's select)✅ Request-response via channel-in-channel pattern

  It's Go's concurrency model, implemented in Rust's async runtime (Tokio).

  The only difference:
  - Go: Preemptive goroutines + CSP channels
  - Rust/llm_fusion: Cooperative async tasks + Tokio channels

  But the pattern is identical: channels all the way down! 🚀
